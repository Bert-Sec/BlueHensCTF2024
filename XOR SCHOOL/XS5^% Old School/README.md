P.S. I would never want you to think of a problem as guessy, if you think this is guessy I encourage you to reserve judgement and do this one AFTER the other ones.

*This series of problems is called the XOR SCHOOL.  For whatever reason I just love xor problems and over the years there are many that have charmed my soul.  This sequence is an homage to the many many ways that xor shows up in CTFs.  I hope you can see some of the beauty that I see through them. -ProfNinja*
