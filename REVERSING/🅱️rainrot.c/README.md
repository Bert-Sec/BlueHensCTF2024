## Challenge Description
```
I would like to apologize for the crimes that have been committed upon humanity and the mental trauma that may ensue from the creation of this code. I take full responsibility for my actions and ask only for forgiveness as you struggle in pursuit of the flag. I have provided C source code and omitted the header that serves as the gen-z Rosetta Stone. I wish you all the best in successful completion of this problem.
